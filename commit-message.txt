refactor(terminology): Use correct Obsidian terminology

This commit refactors the codebase to use the correct Obsidian terminology. "Window" is now used to refer to a `WorkspaceWindow` instance (the main window or a pop-out), and "tab group" is used to refer to a pane within a window that holds a set of tabs.

- Renamed `_getFilesFromWindow` to `_getFilesFromTabGroup`.
- Renamed commands and user-facing strings to use "tab group".
- Renamed `tests/window-commands.test.ts` to `tests/tab-group-commands.test.ts` and updated its content.
- Updated `README.md` to use the correct terminology.
