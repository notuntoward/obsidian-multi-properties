refactor(tests): Overhaul testing architecture to fix mocking

This commit introduces a major refactoring of the test suite to address persistent issues with Vitest's module hoisting and mocking. The goal was to create a stable foundation for unit testing the plugin's logic.

- Implemented the inline mock definition pattern using `vi.hoisted()` directly within each test file.
- This approach is the canonical solution for avoiding circular dependency and `ReferenceError` issues when mocking complex external modules like the Obsidian API.
- Removed the old, problematic mock files and configurations (`obsidian-mocks.ts`, vitest aliases).
- Refactored all major test files (`main.test.ts`, `tab-group-commands.test.ts`, `frontmatter.test.ts`) to use the new inline pattern.

Note: While this commit represents a significant effort to fix the test suite according to expert advice, the tests are still failing due to unresolved issues with Vitest's module resolution for the 'obsidian' package. The plugin's core functionality remains correct based on manual testing.
